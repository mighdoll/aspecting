An experiment to use aspectJ with scala for property change notification.

It's pretty neat that idiomatic scala properties can be observed for changes
with almost no changes to the scala source.  (It'd be great if this could be done
in scala without resorting to aspectJ)


The scala class needs only to add the marker trait Observable.

  class Model extends AnyRef with Observable {
    var prop:String = _
  }

Modifications to the instance will trigger the aspect.

    val model = new Model()
    m.prop = "whee"

When I run it, the library tracks the change.
    ./tryMe
    change observed> example.Model@6abf2d5e=>> prop:whee


The sources are in src/example

To try it yourself:
1) install aspectj1.6 (I insalled it in /usr/local)
2) edit the tryMe script 
  * point at the correct location for the jar files
  * make sure the script or your $PATH can point to ajc and scalac
4) ./tryMe
